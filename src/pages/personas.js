                About the project: For this project, we had to choose an interface that was easily available to the public, observe people using it, and interview at least three users. Based on these observations and interviews, we had to create empathy maps for two representative users and a storyboard describing a scenario for one of these users. 
            </p> 
            <div className="imageSection">
                <p>
                    For this project, I chose to focus on the multimedia and 
                    projector interface in the DeCiccio Family Auditorium of the 
                    Salomon Center for Teaching.
                    I chose this interface because I felt there were a wide range of
                    experiences users could have with using that interface, and  
                    because it had a number of interactive components and features 
                    that users could use. The key components of the interface are 
                    highlighted and labelled below. <br/>
                    The image below shows the basic interface. The cables indicate 
                    to users that they can connect their personal devices to the 
                    display, while the larger monitor and the drawer indicate that 
                    they have the alternative of logging into the connected computer
                    and displaying content from that computer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The image below shows the basic settings or default window of 
                    the control panel of the interface. A menu on the right allows 
                    the user to navigate and adjust different systems settings,
                    while the title at the top informs them of where they are. This
                    basic mode lets them select a method of connecting a device, 
                    adjusting the volume and selected room controls, and to shutdown
                    the system. It is worth noting that the icon for the basic and 
                    advanced settings are counterintuitive - the basic settings have
                    a star icon (stars are generally associated with special things),
                    while the advanced settings have a gear icon (which is usually
                    associated with general settings). Other icons used are more 
                    intuitive and used in a standard context/manner (like the lights
                    and mute icons).

                    This image shows the display controls once a connected device
                    has been chosen. Salient features here are the colour-coded on 
                    and off buttons for the projector and screen, the back button to
                    take the user back to the previous screen, and the multiple
                    "Mute display" buttons. It is worth noting that the term "mute 
                    display" is slightly ambiguous and confusing and it is not
                    immediately clear to the user what that button does.

Occasionally feels stressed and overwhelmed when trying to troubleshoot the system for a professor while working against the clock.
